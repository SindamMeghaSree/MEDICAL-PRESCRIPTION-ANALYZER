# MEDICAL-PRESCRIPTION-ANALYZER
This project is built for the CognitiveX GenAI Hackathon. It leverages IBM Watsonx.ai Granite models and IBM Cloud services to automatically verify medical prescriptions. The solution helps patients, doctors, and pharmacists by validating prescribed medicines against a curated dataset of standard drugs, dosages, and alternatives.
